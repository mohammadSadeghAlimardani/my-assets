1,Abril Fatface,https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Abril+Fatface,Header,"Roboto, Raleway, Montserrat","Abril Fatface is part of a bigger type family system, Abril, which includes 18 styles for all Display and Text uses. The titling weights are a contemporary revamp of classic Didone styles, display both neutrality and strong presence on the page to attract reader attention with measured tension by its curves, good color and high contrast. Abril Fatface in particular is inspired by the heavy titling fonts used in advertising posters in 19th century Britain and France. The thin serifs and clean curves lend the typeface a refined touch that give any headline an elegant appearance. The Extended Latin character set supports over 50 languages, including those from Central and Northern Europe."
2,Alex Brush,https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Alex+Brush,Header,"Open Sans, Lato, Roboto Slab",Alex Brush is a beautifully flowing brush script. It has short ascenders and descenders allowing a legibility not seen in other script fonts.
3,Archivo Black,https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Archivo+Black,Header,"Roboto, Montserrat, Oswald","Archivo Black was designed to be used simultaneously in print and digital platforms. The technical and aesthetic characteristics of the font are both crafted for high performance typography. It was designed to be used simultaneously in print and online platforms and supports over 200 world languages. Archivo is a grotesque sans serif typeface family from Omnibus-Type. It was originally designed for highlights and headlines. This family is reminiscent of late nineteenth century American typefaces. It includes normal, Black and Narrow styles, and was derived from Chivo."
4,Archivo Narrow,https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Archivo+Narrow?preview.text=&preview.text_type=custom&query=Archivo+Narrow,Header,"Barlow, Roboto, Fira Sans","Archivo Narrow was designed to be used simultaneously in print and digital platforms.

5,Arial,https://www.fonts.com/font/monotype/arial?QueryFontType=Web&src=GoogleWebFonts,Both,"Georgia, Oswald, Verdana ","Arial was designed for Monotype in 1982 by Robin Nicholas and Patricia Saunders. A contemporary sans serif design, Arial contains more humanist characteristics than many of its predecessors and as such is more in tune with the mood of the last decades of the twentieth century. The overall treatment of curves is softer and fuller than in most industrial style sans serif faces. Terminal strokes are cut on the diagonal which helps to give the face a less mechanical appearance. Arial is an extremely versatile family of typefaces which can be used with equal success for text setting in reports, presentations, magazines etc, and for display use in newspapers, advertising and promotions."
6,Arimo,https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Arimo?preview.text=&preview.text_type=custom&query=Arimo#about,Body,"Roboto, Open Sans, Montserrat","Arimo was designed by Steve Matteson as an innovative, refreshing sans serif design that is metrically compatible with Arial™. Arimo offers improved on-screen readability characteristics and the pan-European WGL character set and solves the needs of developers looking for width-compatible fonts to address document portability across platforms."
7,Arvo,https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Arvo?preview.text=&preview.text_type=custom&query=arvo,Header,"Lato, Roboto, Open Sans","Arvo is a geometric slab-serif typeface family suited for screen and print. The family includes 4 cuts: Roman, Italic, Roman Bold, Bold Italic. It is a libre font, first published in Google Fonts. The flavour of the font is rather mixed. It's monolinear-ish, but has a tiny bit of contrast (which increases the legibility a little in Mac OS X.) The name Arvo is a typical Estonian man's name, but is not widely used today. In the Finnish language, Arvo means ""number, value, worth."" Considering how much programming is involved in hinting, all these meanings are true."
8,Barcelony,https://www.behance.net/gallery/80458759/BARCELONY-FREE-SCRIPT-FONT,Header,-,"Barcelony Signature is a elegant and a smooth casual monoline signature stylish script. Barcelony Signature is perfect for branding projects, logo, wedding designs, social media posts, advertisements, product packaging, product designs, label, photography, watermark, invitation, stationery and any projects that need handwriting taste."
9,Barlow,https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Barlow?query=Barlow,Both,"Lato, Barlow Condensed, Fira Sans","Barlow is a slightly rounded, low-contrast, grotesk type family. Drawing from the visual style of the California public, Barlow shares qualities with the state's car plates, highway signs, busses, and trains. This is the Normal family, which is part of the superfamily along with Semi Condensed and Condensed, each with 9 weights in Roman and Italic."
10,Cabin,https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Cabin,Both,"Source Sans Pro, Raleway, Roboto","Cabin is a humanist sans inspired by Edward Johnston's and Eric Gill's typefaces, with a touch of modernism. Cabin incorporates modern proportions, optical adjustments, and some elements of the geometric sans. It remains true to its roots, but has its own personality. The Cabin font family comes in two variable fonts, roman and true italic, with a Weight range from Regular to Bold, and a Width range from normal to Condensed. The stroke contrast is almost monolinear, although top and bottom curves are slightly thinned. Counters of the b, g, p and q are rounded, and all are optically adjusted."
11,Cantarell,https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Cantarell,Header,"Roboto, Oxygen, Ubuntu","The Cantarell typeface family was designed as a graduation project for the MA Typeface Design programme in the Department of Typography at the University of Reading (UK.) A contemporary humanist sans serif, it was developed for on-screen reading; in particular, reading web pages on cheap Android devices."
12,Cardo,https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Cardo,Body,"Open Sans, Crimson Text, Ubuntu","Cardo is a large Unicode font specifically designed for the needs of classicists, Biblical scholars, medievalists, and linguists. It also works well for general typesetting in situations where a high-quality Old Style font is appropriate. Its large character set supports many modern languages as well as those needed by scholars. Cardo also contains features that are required for high-quality typography such as ligatures, text figures (also known as old style numerals), true small capitals and a variety of punctuation and space characters."
13,EB Garamond,https://fonts.google.com/specimen/EB+Garamond?preview.text=&preview.text_type=custom&query=Garamond#pairings,Header,"Roboto, Open Sans, Montserrat","EB Garamond is intended to be an excellent, classical, Garamond. It is a community project to create a revival of Claude Garamont’s famous humanist typefaces from the mid-16th century. This digital version reproduces the original design by Claude Garamont closely: The source for the letterforms is a scan of a specimen known as the “Berner specimen,” which was composed in 1592 by Conrad Berner, the son-in-law of Christian Egenolff and his successor at the Egenolff print office. This specimen shows Garamont’s roman and Granjon’s italic types at different sizes. Hence the name of this project: Egenolff-Berner Garamond. Why another Garamond? That typeface is a key moment in the history of typography, and European type designers have been reacting to this work ever since. It is probably the most revived typeface in the world and many are excellent. In the world of free/libre culture, however, only a few Garamond-inspired types exist, and none share the scope of this project."
14,Exo,https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Exo+2,Header,"Open Sans, Roboto, PT Sans","Exo 2 is a complete redrawing of Exo, a contemporary geometric sans serif typeface that tries to convey a technological/futuristic feeling while keeping an elegant design. Exo is a very versatile font, so it has 9 weights (the maximum on the web) and each with a true italic version. Exo 2 has a more organic look that will perform much better at small text sizes and in long texts."
15,Heebo,https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Heebo,Both,"Roboto, Open Sans, Montserrat","Heebo is a Hebrew and Latin typeface family, which extends Christian Roberton's Roboto Latin to Hebrew. The Hebrew was drawn by Oded Ezer and the font files were mastered by Meir Sadan. Since the Hebrew design of this family is primary, the vertical metrics are different to the original Roboto family. This family is auto-hinted, whereas Roboto is hand-hinted, so the rendering quality of Roboto may be better on older Windows machines."
16,Inknut,https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inknut+Antiqua,Header,"Rubik, PT Serif, Archivo Narrow","Inknut Antiqua« is an Antiqua typeface for literature and long-form text. Approaching the idea of web-publishing as a modern day private press, it is designed to evoke Venetian incunabula and humanist manuscripts, but with the quirks and idiosyncrasies of the kinds of typefaces you find in this artisanal tradition. It comes with a complement of typographical sorts and OpenType features for the purpose. The proportions of Inknut Antiqua make it well suited for low-resolution screens."
17,Karla,https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Karla,Both,"Montserrat, Lato, Roboto","Karla is a grotesque sans serif family designed for the Latin and Tamil scripts. This is the Latin part of the family, which has been expanded now to a variable font with a weight axis ranging from ExtraLight to ExtraBold plus full support of Western, Central, and South-Eastern European languages."
18,Lato,https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lato,Header,"Open Sans, Oswald, Raleway","Lato is a sans serif typeface family started in the summer of 2010 by Warsaw-based designer Łukasz Dziedzic (“Lato” means “Summer” in Polish). In December 2010 the Lato family was published under the Open Font License by his foundry tyPoland, with support from Google. In the last ten or so years, during which Łukasz has been designing type, most of his projects were rooted in a particular design task that he needed to solve. With Lato, it was no different. Originally, the family was conceived as a set of corporate fonts for a large client — who in the end decided to go in different stylistic direction, so the family became available for a public release. When working on Lato, Łukasz tried to carefully balance some potentially conflicting priorities. He wanted to create a typeface that would seem quite “transparent” when used in body text but would display some original traits when used in larger sizes. He used classical proportions (particularly visible in the uppercase) to give the letterforms familiar harmony and elegance. At the same time, he created a sleek sans serif look, which makes evident the fact that Lato was designed in 2010 — even though it does not follow any current trend. The semi-rounded details of the letters give Lato a feeling of warmth, while the strong structure provides stability and seriousness. “Male and female, serious but friendly. With the feeling of the Summer,” says Łukasz."
19,Libre Baskerville,https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Libre+Baskerville,Header,"Open Sans, Raleway, Lato","Libre Baskerville is a web font optimized for body text (typically 16px.) It is based on the American Type Founder's Baskerville from 1941, but it has a taller x-height, wider counters and a little less contrast, that allow it to work well for reading on-screen."
20,Lobster,https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lobster,Header,"Open Sans, Oswald, Raleway","The Lobster font took a different approach. The new OpenType format gives us the possibility to have multiple versions of each letter, and that's exactly what we are doing: Instead of compromising the design of our letters to force connections, we do what lettering artist do. We draw many versions of each letter and a lot of different letter-pairs (aka ""ligatures"") so we always use the best possible variation of each letter depending of the context of the letter inside each word. All this happens automatically in any browser that supports ligatures."
21,Lora,https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lora,Header,"Roboto, Lato, Poppins","Lora is a well-balanced contemporary serif with roots in calligraphy. It is a text typeface with moderate contrast well suited for body text. A paragraph set in Lora will make a memorable appearance because of its brushed curves in contrast with driving serifs. The overall typographic voice of Lora perfectly conveys the mood of a modern-day story, or an art essay."
22,Merriweather,https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Merriweather,Header,"Merriweather Sans, Open Sans, Roboto","Merriweather was designed to be a text face that is pleasant to read on screens. It features a very large x height, slightly condensed letterforms, a mild diagonal stress, sturdy serifs and open forms."
23,Montserrat,https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat,Both,"Roboto, Roboto Slab, Open Sans","The old posters and signs in the traditional Montserrat neighborhood of Buenos Aires inspired Julieta Ulanovsky to design this typeface and rescue the beauty of urban typography that emerged in the first half of the twentieth century. As urban development changes that place, it will never return to its original form and loses forever the designs that are so special and unique. The letters that inspired this project have work, dedication, care, color, contrast, light and life, day and night! These are the types that make the city look so beautiful. The Montserrat Project began with the idea to rescue what is in Montserrat and set it free under a libre license, the SIL Open Font License. This is the normal family, and it has two sister families so far, Alternates and Subrayada. Many of the letterforms are special in the Alternates family, while 'Subrayada' means 'Underlined' in Spanish and celebrates a special style of underline that is integrated into the letterforms found in the Montserrat neighborhood."
24,Mulish,https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Mulish,Both,"Montserrat, Oswald, Poppins","Mulish is a minimalist Sans Serif typeface, designed for both display and text typography. It was initially drawn in 2011 by Vernon Adams and then refined until 2014, adding more weights, support for more Latin languages, tightened the spacing and kerning and made many glyph refinements throughout the family – all based on hundreds of users' feedback. In 2017 the family was updated by Jacques Le Bailly to complete the work started by Vernon after he passed away, in collaboration with his wife Allison, an arist who holds the trademark on the typeface family name. In August 2019, it was updated with a Variable Font ""Weight"" axis"
25,Neuton,https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Neuton,Body,"Montserrat, Libre Baskerville, Pacifico","Neuton is a clean, dark, somewhat Dutch-inspired serif font which reminds you a little of Times. It has a large height, short extenders, and a compact width for better screen use, and economy of space. The family will comprise a regular, italic, and cursive, each in five weights and with smallcaps. Two italics — one will be called ""italic"", and the other ""cursive"" — are uncommon, but very useful. Ever tried emphasizing something already emphasized? Beyond that obvious example, there are other uses. Sometimes a text needs a different flavor or feel. While one roman can work for a variety of texts, the companion italics don't always. In more classical or personal documents, a stiff, sober, modern and down-to-earth italic will never work. And in many essays, some of the fancier italics look ridiculous. Who said a roman needs only one companion?"
26,Open Sans,https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Open+Sans,Body,"Roboto, Open Sans, Montserrat","Open Sans is a humanist sans serif typeface designed by Steve Matteson, Type Director of Ascender Corp. This version contains the complete 897 character set, which includes the standard ISO Latin 1, Latin CE, Greek and Cyrillic character sets. Open Sans was designed with an upright stress, open forms and a neutral, yet friendly appearance. It was optimized for print, web, and mobile interfaces, and has excellent legibility characteristics in its letterforms."
27,Oswald,https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Oswald,Header,"Open Sans, Roboto, Lato","Oswald is a reworking of the classic style historically represented by the 'Alternate Gothic' sans serif typefaces. The characters of Oswald were initially re-drawn and reformed to better fit the pixel grid of standard digital screens. Oswald is designed to be used freely across the internet by web browsers on desktop computers, laptops and mobile devices. Since the initial launch in 2011, Oswald was updated continually by Vernon Adams until 2014. Vernon added Light and Bold weights, support for more Latin languages, tightened the spacing and kerning and made many glyph refinements throughout the family based on hundreds of users' feedback. In 2016 the family was updated by Kalapi Gajjar and Alexei Vanyashin to complete the work started by Vernon, and support languages that use the Cyrillic script. In January 2019, it was updated with a variable font Weight axis."
28,Oxygen,https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Oxygen,Both,"Fira Sans, Ubuntu, Roboto","The Oxygen typeface family is created as part of the KDE Project, a libre desktop for the GNU+Linux operating system. The design is optimized for the FreeType font rendering system and works well in all graphical user interfaces, desktops and devices."
29,Pacifico,https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Pacifico,Header,"Roboto, Oswald, Montserrat","Aloha! Pacifico is an original and fun brush script handwriting font by Vernon Adams which was inspired by the 1950s American surf culture in 2011. It was redrawn by Jacques Le Bailly at Baron von Fonthausen in 2016. It was expanded to Cyrillic by Botjo Nikoltchev and Ani Petrova at Lettersoup in 2017. The Pacifico project was commissioned by Google from Vernon Adams, an English type designer who lived in San Clemente, Los Angeles, USA. To contribute, see github.com/googlefonts/Pacifico"
30,Playfair Display,https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playfair+Display?,Header,"Roboto, Open Sans, Lato","Playfair is a transitional design. In the European Enlightenment in the late 18th century, broad nib quills were replaced by pointed steel pens as the popular writing tool of the day. Together with developments in printing technology, ink, and paper making, it became to print letterforms of high contrast and delicate hairlines that were increasingly detached from the written letterforms. This design lends itself to this period, and while it is not a revival of any particular design, it takes influence from the designs of John Baskerville and from ‘Scotch Roman’ designs. Being a Display (large size) design in the transitional genre, functionally and stylistically it can accompany Georgia for body text. This is the main family, with a sibling Playfair Display SC small caps family. The main family downloaded font files include a full set of small caps, common ligatures, and discretionary ligatures."
31,Poppins,https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poppins?,Body,"Roboto, Open Sans, Lora","Geometric sans serif typefaces have been a popular design tool ever since these actors took to the world’s stage. Poppins is one of the new comers to this long tradition. With support for the Devanagari and Latin writing systems, it is an internationalist take on the genre. Many of the Latin glyphs (such as the ampersand) are more constructed and rationalist than is typical. The Devanagari design is particularly new, and is the first ever Devanagari typeface with a range of weights in this genre. Just like the Latin, the Devanagari is based on pure geometry, particularly circles. Each letterform is nearly monolinear, with optical corrections applied to stroke joints where necessary to maintain an even typographic color. The Devanagari base character height and the Latin ascender height are equal; Latin capital letters are shorter than the Devanagari characters, and the Latin x-height is set rather high."
32,Prata,https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Prata,Header,"Roboto, Oswald , Montserrat","Prata is an elegant Didone typeface with sharp features and organic teardrops. There is a certain tension in the contrast of its virile serifs and soft refined curves. Its triangular serifs complement and accent the thin strokes, and the high contrast means it will work best in display sizes."
33,Proza Libre,https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Proza+Libre,Both,"Roboto Slab, Rubik, Karla","Proza Libre is the libre version of the retail Proza type family, by Bureau Roffa. It is made to render exceptionally well on screens across different operating systems, especially Windows, using ttfautohint."
34,Quicksand,https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Quicksand,Both,"Open Sans, Roboto, Raleway","Quicksand is a display sans serif with rounded terminals. The project was initiated by Andrew Paglinawan in 2008 using geometric shapes as a core foundation. It is designed for display purposes but kept legible enough to use in small sizes as well. In 2016, in collaboration with Andrew, it was thoroughly revised by Thomas Jockin to improve the quality. In 2019, Mirko Velimirovic converted the family into a variable font."
35,Raleway,https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Raleway,Both,"Open Sans, Roboto, Oswald","Raleway is an elegant sans-serif typeface family. Initially designed by Matt McInerney as a single thin weight, it was expanded into a 9 weight family by Pablo Impallari and Rodrigo Fuenzalida in 2012 and iKerned by Igino Marini. A thorough review and italic was added in 2016. It is a display face and the download features both old style and lining numerals, standard and discretionary ligatures, a pretty complete set of diacritics, as well as a stylistic alternate inspired by more geometric sans-serif typefaces than its neo-grotesque inspired default character set."
36,Roboto ,https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto,Both,"Open Sans, Noto Sans JP, Lato","Roboto has a dual nature. It has a mechanical skeleton and the forms are largely geometric. At the same time, the font features friendly and open curves. While some grotesks distort their letterforms to force a rigid rhythm, Roboto doesn’t compromise, allowing letters to be settled into their natural width. This makes for a more natural reading rhythm more commonly found in humanist and serif types."

40,Verdana,https://www.fonts.com/font/microsoft-corporation/verdana,Both,"Arial, PT Sans, Lucida Grande","The Verdana Family of fonts was created specifically to address the challenges of on-screen display. Designed by world renowned type designer Matthew Carter, and hand-hinted by leading hinting expert, Tom Rickner, these sans serif fonts are unique examples of type design for the computer screen. The generous width and spacing of Verdana's characters is key to the legibility of these fonts on the screen. Despite the quality of the Verdana font family at small sizes it is at higher resolutions that the fonts are best appreciated. In the words of Tom Rickner, ‘My hope now is that these faces will be enjoyed beyond just the computer screen. Although the screen size bitmaps were the most crucial in the production of these fonts [their] uses should not be limited to on screen typography. Character Set: Latin-1, WGL Pan-European (Eastern Europe, Cyrillic, Greek and Turkish)."
41,Work Sans,https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Work+Sans,Header,"Roboto, Open Sans, Lato","Work Sans is a typeface family based loosely on early Grotesques, such as those by Stephenson Blake, Miller & Richard and Bauerschen Giesserei. The Regular weight and others in the middle of the family are optimised for on-screen text usage at medium-sizes (14px-48px) and can also be used in print design. The fonts closer to the extreme weights are designed more for display use both on the web and in print. Overall, features are simplified and optimised for screen resolutions; for example, diacritic marks are larger than how they would be in print. A version optimised for desktop applications is available from the Work Sans github project page."
